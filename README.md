<!-- the cruds project -->
The CRUDS project is a JavaScript project that manages products. The first "C" in "CRUDS" refers to "Create", which allows us to add products. The "R" in "CRUDS" refers to "Read", which allows us to view product information. The "U" refers to "Update", which allows us to modify product information. The "D" refers to "Delete", which allows us to remove products from the system. There are two ways to delete products: one-by-one or all at once. Finally, the "S" refers to "Search". We can search for a product in two ways: by its name or by its category.
